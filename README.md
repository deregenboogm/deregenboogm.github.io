## Projects

The project, being a capstone team project, was submitted to DEEPLO AI in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the graduation of Data Science & Machine Learning Course. I have completed the part II of the project and created an automatic web-scraping and text summarization tool through using Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques, the Python Programming language and related libraries. The tool collects and processes qualitative data about COVID-19 from publicly available sources in order to provide advice for public and enable them to easily follow news and important issues around the pandemic (for the whole project, see [humanitariandata.co](https://humanitariandata.co/))
